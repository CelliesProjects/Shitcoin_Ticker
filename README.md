# Shitcoin_Ticker

This is a simple coin ticker that connects to `api.kraken.com` to get the trade data. This is a public api so account at kraken.com is needed.

Included is the public SSL key cypher block so the connection is secure until the SSL certificate becomes invalid.

The certificate will become invalid at `august 5 2022, 1:59:59 AM GMT+2`.
